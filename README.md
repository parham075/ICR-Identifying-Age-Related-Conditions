# ICR-Identifying-Age-Related-Conditions
## Context
They say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.

I work with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, youâ€™ll create a model to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.
